This is where links/descriptions to the different things is going.
Why don't we try displaying the most recent post here:

<ul>
  <li>Picture</li>
  <li>Snippit about myself</li>
  <li>Button for downloading CV</li>
  <li>Button for sending me an email</li>
  <li>Current Employment</li>
  <li>Education History</li>
</ul>

Here is where I should put the Projects category with a changing pane
<ul>
  <li>Projects</li>
  <li>Publications</li>
  <li>Posters</li>
  <li>Talks</li>
</ul>
